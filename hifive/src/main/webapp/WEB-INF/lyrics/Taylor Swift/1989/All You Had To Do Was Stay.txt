All You Had To Do Was Stay - Taylor Swift

Written by£ºTaylor Swift/Max Martin

People like you always want back

The love they gave away

And people like me wanna believe you

When you say you've changed

The more I think about it now

The less I know

All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay

Hey all you had to do was stay

Had me in the palm of your hand

Then why you had to go and lock me out

When I let you in

Stay hey now you say you want it back

But now it's just too late

Well could've been easy all you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

Here you are now

Calling me up

But I don't know what to say

I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made

People like you always want back

The love they pushed aside

But people like me are gone forever

When you say goodbye

Stay

Hey all you had to do was stay

Had me in the palm of your hand

Then why you had to go and lock me out

When I let you in

Stay hey now you say you want it back

But now it's just too late

Well could've been easy all you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

Let me remind you this was what you wanted

You ended it

You were all I wanted

But not like this

Not like this

Not like this

Oh all you had to do was stay

Hey all you had to do was stay

Had me in the palm of your hand

Then why you had to go and lock me out

When I let you in

Stay hey now you say you want it back

But now it's just too late

Well could've been easy all you had to do was stay

Hey all you had to do was stay

Had me in the palm of your hand

Then why you had to go and lock me out

When I let you in

Stay hey now you say you want it back

But now it's just too late

Well could've been easy all you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
