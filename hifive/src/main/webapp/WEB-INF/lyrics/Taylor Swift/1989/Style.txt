Midnight

You come and pick me up no headlights

A long drive

Could end in burning flames or paradise

Fade into view oh it's been a while since I have even

Heard from you heard from you

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I

Know exactly where it leads but I

Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that james dean daydream look in your eye

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

And when we go crashing down we come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style

We never go out of style

You got that long hair slicked back white t-shirt

And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

And when we go crashing down we come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style

We never go out of style

So it goes

He can't keep his wild eyes on the road

Takes me home

Lights are off he's taking off his coat

I say I heard oh that you've been out and about

With some other girl some other girl

He says what you've heard is true but I

Can't stop thinking about you and I

I said I've been there too a few times

'Cause you got that james dean daydream look in your eye

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

And when we go crashing down we come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style

We never go out of style

You got that long hair slicked back white t-shirt

And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

And when we go crashing down we come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style

We never go out of style

Take me home

Just take me home yeah

Just take me home

Out of style

You got that james dean daydream look in your eye

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

And when we go crashing down we come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style

We never go out of style
