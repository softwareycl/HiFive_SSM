Out Of The Woods - Taylor Swift

Written by£ºTaylor Swift/Jack Antonov

Looking at it now

It all seems so simple

We were lying on your couch

I remember

You took a Polaroid of us

Then discovered

The rest of the world

Was black and white

But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

In the clear yet good

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

In the clear yet good

Are we out of the woods

Looking at it now

Last December

We were built to fall apart

Then fall back together

Your necklace hanging from my neck

The night we couldn't quite forget

When we decided

We decided

To move the furniture

So we could dance

Baby like we stood a chance

Two paper airplanes flying flying

Flying

And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

In the clear yet good

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

In the clear yet good

Are we out of the woods

Remember when you hit

The brakes too soon

Twenty stitches in a hospital room

When you started crying

Baby I did too

But when the sun came up

I was looking at you

Remember

When we couldn't take the heat

I walked out

I said "I'm setting you free"

But the monsters

Turned out to be just trees

When the sun came up

You were looking at me

You were looking at me

Oh

You were looking at me

I remember

Oh I remember

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

In the clear yet good

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

In the clear yet good

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

In the clear yet good

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods yet

Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

Are we in the clear yet

In the clear yet good
