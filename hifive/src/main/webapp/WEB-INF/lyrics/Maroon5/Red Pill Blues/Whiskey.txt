Leaves are fallin' it's September

The night came in and made her shiver

I told her she could have my jacket

Wrapped it tight around her shoulders

And I was so young 'til she kissed me

Like a whiskey like a whiskey

I never knew that love was blind

'Til I was hers but she was never mine

Yeah I was reckless

But I let it burn I let it burn yeah

The feeling it was bittersweet

Realizing I was in too deep

She was a lesson

I had to learn I had to learn yeah

I used to try to forget her

But now I smile when I remember

Leaves are fallin' it's September

The night came in and made her shiver

I told her she could have my jacket

Wrapped it tight around her shoulders

And I was so young 'til she kissed me

Like a whiskey like a whiskey

Woah like a whiskey

Woah

Would've left this world behind

Just to wake up by your side

Every mornin' I

Would've sold my soul for a little more time

Would've waited a thousand nights

If she never said goodbye

I admit that I

Would've sold my soul for a little more time

I used to try to forget her

But now I smile when I remember

Leaves are fallin' it's September

The night came in and made her shiver

I told her she could have my jacket

Wrapped it tight around her shoulders

And I was so young 'til she kissed me

Like a whiskey like a whiskey

I ain't like the other Cognacs

Or type of cat that'd never call back or lose contact

When you runnin' out of rum and you make a run

Feelin' light and dizzy might be tipsy

All of that tequila's a killer little vodka

Break her off somethin' proper

Pop a cork and play spin the bottle

Every time you kiss me like some whiskey

Punch drunk love it's a fine line

Dom P¨¦rignon she the fine wine

Someone call 911 I'm runnin' out of time

She done got off my heart

Leaves are fallin' it's September woah

The night came in and made her shiver

I told her she could have my jacket

Wrapped it tight around her shoulders

And I was so young so young

'Til she kissed me yeah

Like a whiskey yeah

And I was so young so young

'Til she kissed me

Like a whiskey like a whiskey
